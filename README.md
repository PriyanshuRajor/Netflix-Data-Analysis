# Netflix-Data-Analysis using Python and its Libraries
Netflix is known for its work in data science, AI, and ML, particularly for building strong recommendation models and algorithms that understand customer behavior and patterns. Suppose you are working in a data-driven job role, and you have a dataset of more than 9,000 movies. 
Imagine you're working in a data-driven role, analyzing a dataset of over 9,000 movies on Netflix. Using Python for data analysis, you need to answer the following questions:

Which movie genre appears most frequently on Netflix?
Which movie has the highest average vote count?
Which movie has the highest popularity, and what is its genre?
Which movie has the lowest popularity, and what is its genre?
In which year were the most movies released?
